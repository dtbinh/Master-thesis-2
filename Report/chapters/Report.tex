\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgement}
This is the final work of my master studies of Mechanical Engineering at ETH Zurich and UC Berkeley. I would like to thank Professor Borrelli who gave me the chance to work on this thesis together with him and his team at UC Berkeley. I would also like to thank my advisors Ugo Rosolia and Jon Gonzales who always supported me throughout the entire work in both theoretical and practical questions.\\
I would like to thank my supervisors at ETH Zurich, Prof. Thomas Roesgen and Prof. Roy Smith, for guiding me through my master's program, providing valuable advice throughout my studies and supporting me for my master thesis.\\
I would also like to thank my parents for giving me the opportunity to follow my studies at ETH Zurich and writing my master thesis at UC Berkeley.\\
Last but not least I would like to thank all my friends who I met during my course of studies and who showed me different paths one could follow as a student of engineering. I would not be where I am without them.

\chapter*{Abstract}
%% Note: From what I found out, literature uses the terms "repetitive" for the control and "periodic" for the type of the system.  I didn't find anything where this definition is clearly stated but I would use this terminology.
% Also, "periodic" is always used in terms of time, not in state.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
%A Learning Model Predictive Control strategy is extended to repetitive {\bfseries{Need to check the definition of repetitive MPC and periodic MPC. We need to align with what the community is using}} systems. The presented controller is able to improve its performance with every iteration by learning from previous iterations. It is applied to an autonomous race driving problem. Simulations on a kinematic and a dynamic bicycle model show the controller's performance. Additionally, the strategy is applied to a 1:10 scale RC car. An estimator using an indoor ultrasound based GPS as well as an IMU and wheel encoders is developed. The system's dynamics are identified online using Linear Regression.
%Experiments are performed on a small race track, reaching maximum velocities of $\SI{3}{\meter\per\second}$. \\

%{\bfseries{OK that is what I would write.}}\\

%A Learning Model Predictive Control (LMPC) for periodic tasks is presented. The proposed LMPC frameworks builds on \cite{Rosolia2016} and extends its range of applicability to systems subject to periodic cycles. The proposed controller learns from data to improve the performance of the closed-loop system at each iteration. A terminal cost and a sampled safe set that take into account the period of the system are used to guarantee recursive feasibility and non-decreasing performance cost at each iterations. The proposed control logic is tested on an autonomous racing example, where the vehicle dynamics are identified online. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These are bolstered by experimental results on a 1:10 scale RC car. Experimental results were possible thanks to an estimation techniques proposed in this work, where indoor ultrasound based GPS, IMU and wheel encoders measurements are combined to estimate the system state.

%%%% even newer version:
A Learning Model Predictive Control (LMPC) strategy for periodic tasks is presented. The proposed controller learns from previous iteration data to improve the performance of a closed loop system in each iteration. A sampled safe set and terminal cost function is used to guarantee recursive feasibility and non-decreasing performance cost in each iteration. The proposed control is tested on an autonomous racing example. Vehicle dynamics are identified online using Linear Regression. The control strategy is implemented on a 1:10 scale RC race car. Sensor data from an ultrasound based GPS and IMU are used to estimate the system state. Finally, experiments show the real time feasibility of an optimal trajectory generation with online system identification.
