	Abstract = {Executive Summary World Robotics 2016 Industrial Robots 2015: By far the highest volume ever recorded In 2015, robot sales increased by 15{\%} to 253,748 units, again by far the highest level ever recorded for one year. The main driver of the growth in 2015 was the general industry with an increase of 33{\%} compared to 2014, in particular the electronics industry (+41{\%}), metal industry (+39{\%}), the chemical, plastics and rubber industry (+16{\%}). The robot sales in the automotive industry only moderately increased in 2015 after a five year period of continued considerable increase. China has significantly expanded its leading position as the biggest market with a share of 27{\%} of the total supply in 2015. Since 2010, the demand for industrial robots has accelerated considerably due to the ongoing trend toward automation and the continued innovative technical improvements in industrial robots. Between 2010 and 2015, the average robot sales increase was at 16{\%} per year (CAGR). The number of robot installations had never increased so heavily before. Between 2005 and 2008, the average annual number of robots sold was about 115,000 units. 2009 is excluded because the economic and financial crisis in 2008/2009 caused an exceptional plunge in robot sales. Between 2010 and 2015, the average annual supply rose to about 183,000 units. This is an increase of about 59{\%} and a clear sign of the significant rise in demand for industrial robots worldwide. 81},

Traditionally, the design of feedback controllers for linear systems with constraints, for example anti-windup techniques, was ad hoc requiring both much experience and trial and error. Though significant progress has been achieved on anti-windup schemes over the last decade, these techniques deal with input constraints only and cannot be extended easily.},

	Abstract = {A new way of representing tyre data obtained from measurements in pure cornering and pure braking conditions has been developed in order to further improve the Dynamic Safety of vehicles. The method makes use of a formula with coefficients which describe some of the typifying quantities of a tyre, such as slip stiffnesses at zero slip and force and torque peak values. The formula is capable of describing the characteristics of side force, brake force and self aligning torque with great accuracy. This mathematical representation is limited to steady-state conditions during either pure cornering or pure braking and forms the basis for a model describing tyre behaviour during combined braking and cornering.},

@article{Caron2006,
	Abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a GPS/IMU multisensor fusion algorithm, taking context into consideration. Contextual variables are introduced to define fuzzy validity domains of each sensor. The algorithm increases the reliability of the position information. A simulation of this algorithm is then made by fusing GPS and IMU data coming from real tests on a land vehicle. Bad data delivered by GPS sensor are detected and rejected using contextual information thus increasing reliability. Moreover, because of a lack of credibility of GPS signal in some cases and because of the drift of the INS, GPS/INS association is not satisfactory at the moment. In order to avoid this problem, the authors propose to feed the fusion process based on a multisensor Kalman filter directly with the acceleration provided by the IMU. Moreover, the filter developed here gives the possibility to easily add other sensors in order to achieve performances required. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@book{Seeger2004,
	Abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

@article{Gao2010,
	Abstract = {Two frameworks based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) for obstacle avoidance with autonomous vehicles are presented. A given trajectory represents the driver intent. An MPC has to safely avoid obstacles on the road while trying to track the de- sired trajectory by controlling front steering angle and differen- tial braking. We present two different approaches to this problem. The first approach solves a single nonlinear MPC problem. The second approach uses a hierarchical scheme. At the high-level, a trajectory is computed on-line, in a receding horizon fashion, based on a simplified point-mass vehicle model in order to avoid an obstacle. At the low-level anMPCcontroller computes the ve- hicle inputs in order to best follow the high level trajectory based on a nonlinear vehicle model. This article presents the design and comparison of both approaches, the method for implement- ing them, and successful experimental results on icy roads.},

@article{Lam2013,
	Abstract = {Contouring systems involve competing control objectives of maximising accuracy while minimising traversal time. A previously developed model predictive contouring controller for biaxial systems is extended to multi-axis systems subject to joint acceleration and jerk constraints. This requires consideration of manipulator forward kinematics and both position and orientation of the end effector. The control design is based on minimising a cost function which reflects the trade-off between the control objectives. A new architecture is proposed where the joint position controllers operate at a sample rate comparable to industrial machines, while the contouring control scheme operates at a slower rate. The proposed approach is applied to a simulation model of an industrial profile cutting machine. A number of implementations are presented requiring varying degrees of modification to the existing machine hardware and sensing capability. Results demonstrate the effect of the cost function weights on contouring accuracy and traversal time, as well as the trade-off between achieving the best contouring performance and minimising modification of the existing system. 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Ostafew2015,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LB-NMPC) algorithm to achieve high-performance path tracking in challenging off-road terrain through learning. The LB-NMPC algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modeled as a Gaussian process (GP) as a function of system state, input, and other relevant variables. The GP is updated based on experience collected during previous trials. Localization for the controller is provided by an onboard, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results including over 3 km of travel by three significantly different robot platforms with masses ranging from 50 to 600 kg and at speeds ranging from 0.35 to 1.2 m/s (associated video at http://tiny.cc/RoverLearnsDisturbances). Planned speeds are generated by a novel experience-based speed scheduler that balances overall travel time, path-tracking errors, and localization reliability. The results show that the controller can start from a generic a priori vehicle model and subsequently learn to reduce vehicle- and trajectory-specific path-tracking errors based on experience.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, three control methods-iterative learning control (ILC), repetitive control (RC), and run-to-run control (R2R)-are studied and compared. Some mathematical transformations allow ILC, RC, and R2R to be described in a uniform framework that highlights their similarities. These methods, which play an important role in controlling repetitive processes and run-based processes, are collectively referred to as learning-type control in this paper. According to the classification adopted in this paper, learning-type control has two classes-direct form and indirect form. The main ideas and designing procedures for these two patterns are introduced, separately. Approximately 400 papers related to learning-type control are categorized. Statistical analysis of the resulting data reveals some promising fields for learning-type control. Finally, a flowchart based on the unique features of the different methods is presented as a guideline for choosing an appropriate learning-type control for different problems. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Aswani2013,
	Abstract = {Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {With the recent emphasis on batch processing by emerging industries like the microelectronics and biotechnology, the interest in batch process control has been renewed. This paper gives an overview of the iterative learning control (ILC) technique, which can be used to improve tracking control performance in batch processes. The fundamental concepts and review of the various ILC algorithms are presented, with a particular focus on a model-based algorithm called Q-ILC and an application involving a rapid thermal processing (RTP) system. The study indicates that one can solve a seemingly very difficult multivariable nonlinear tracking problem with relative ease by intelligently combining the ILC technique with basic process insights and standard system identification techniques. Some related techniques in the literature are brought forth with the hope of unifying them. We aslo suggest some remaining challenges. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
